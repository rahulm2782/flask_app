The given code defines a function enhance() which enhances an input image and returns a base64 encoded string of the enhanced image in JSON format. Here's the detailed plan for the implementation:

Get the image file from the user through request object and read it using the read() method. 

image_file = request.files['file'].read()


Call the enhance_image() function defined in the functions module and pass the read image file as an argument to obtain the enhanced image. 

enhanced_image = functions.enhance_image(image_file)


Create an object of io.BytesIO() to store the enhanced image in memory.

buffer = io.BytesIO()


Save the enhanced image object to the buffer object. Use format='JPEG' parameter to make sure the image is saved in JPEG format.

enhanced_image.save(buffer, format='JPEG')


Convert the image stored in the buffer object to byte strings using b64encode() method of base64.

encoded_output_img = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode()


Return a JSON object containing the encoded image string with key "OutputImage".

return jsonify({"OutputImage" : encoded_output_img})



Here's the implementation of the plan in the form of the complete code:
import io
import base64

def enhance():
    """
    It takes an image file, enhances it using the function defined, saves it to a buffer, encodes it, and returns it as a JSON
    object.
    :return: The enhanced image is being returned as a base64 encoded string.
    """
    image_file = request.files['file'].read()  #reading file as binary
    enhanced_image = functions.enhance_image(image_file)  
    buffer = io.BytesIO()
    enhanced_image.save(buffer,format='JPEG')
    encoded_output_img = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode() #converting the image into byte strings

    return jsonify({"OutputImage" : encoded_output_img})

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The above code takes an image as input, enhances it, and returns the enhanced image along with the size of both the original and enhanced images.
Here is the plan in pseudocode:
1. Define the function named super_image.
2. Get the image data using request.files['image'].read().
3. Pass the image data to the img_enhance function which returns the enhanced image and the size of the original image.
4. Get the size of the enhanced image.
5. Create a buffer.
6. Save the enhanced image to the buffer in JPEG format.
7. Encode the buffer using base64 encoding.
8. Return the encoded image along with the original and enhanced image sizes in JSON format.

Here is the resulting code:
def super_image():
    """
    It takes an image, enhances it, and returns the enhanced image and the size of the original and
    enhanced images.
    :return: The super_image is being returned as a base64 encoded string.
    """
    image = request.files['image'].read()

    original_image_size, super_image = functions.img_enhance(image)
    super_image_size = super_image.size

    buffer = io.BytesIO()
    super_image.save(buffer, format='JPEG')
    encoded_super_image = base64.b64encode(buffer.getvalue()).decode()
    return jsonify({
        'super_image': encoded_super_image,
        'enhanced_size': super_image_size,
        'original_size': original_image_size
    })
